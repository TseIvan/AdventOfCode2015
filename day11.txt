Rules:

Passwords must include one increasing straight of at least three letters, like abc, bcd, cde, and so on, up to xyz. They cannot skip letters; abd doesn't count.
Passwords may not contain the letters i, o, or l, as these letters can be mistaken for other characters and are therefore confusing.
Passwords must contain at least two different, non-overlapping pairs of letters, like aa, bb, or zz.

hijklmmn meets the first requirement (because it contains the straight hij) but fails the second requirement requirement (because it contains i and l).
abbceffg meets the third requirement (because it repeats bb and ff) but fails the first requirement.
abbcegjk fails the third requirement, because it only has one double letter (bb).
The next password after abcdefgh is abcdffaa.
The next password after ghijklmn is ghjaabcc, because you eventually skip all the passwords that start with ghi..., since i is not allowed.

input <= hxbxwxba (8 character)

If we leave hxbx as is then wxba gives 4 character slots it must also increase and have overlapping characters

So we can try hxbxxyyz -> However xxyyzz is not a 3 letter increasing, next is hxbxxyzz {xx,zz} & {xyz}

Next password makes logical sense to just repeat the same thing except we can wrap xxyzz to aabcc -> hxbaabcc -> fails because we exhausted all password that works with hxb -> hxcaabcc -> success
